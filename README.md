# MH-Visualizations
An interactive graph I designed that takes a .csv file of values that are generated through some python after inputting a list of strings, these values are then plotted out into the graph for comparison of the other lines generated. The values are representative of how much workload each college class has, the valeus are generated based on the level of the course (I.E 100-200, 200-300, etc.) as a base modifier for an algorithm that reads the list of strings and then outputs a list of integers telling how much of a workload, or stress, is being put on students for that class throughout the semester.
